Cucumber Framework Set up

npx cucumber-js 		-> this command runs all the available tests in the defined features path in the cucumber.js

cucumber.js 
	This is your runner
	Cucumber uses its own runner rather than playwright config runner

	In this file we define:
	Where the feature files are
	Where the step definitions/implementations are
	What type of reports to generate
	Format options to generate missing step implementation
	Which tags to run
	DryRun (can be set to true or false to check if any implementation is missing)

CucumberHooks.js
	We created all the before (setup) and after (teardown) actions
		Before()
		After()
		BeforeAll()
		AfterAll()


features which has all the scenarios written in gherkin syntax
	Background: used for common steps to be shared by multiple scenarios and rerun before each


setting up useful VSCode extension to quickly generate and track gherkin step implementation



dryRun: true

will check all your feature files and provide code-snippets for the un-implemented gherkin steps without execution.
